# IEEE Signal Processing CUP 2023 (SP CUP 2023)
IEEE Signal Processing Society organizes the Signal Processing Cup (SP Cup) every year where Machine Learning is used to solve any real-world problem in the Signal Processing field. According to the score of the first round Open Competition, the top 3 teams are selected for the Final round. The Final Round is held at a conference which is IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (IEEE ICASSP 2023). This year the competition problem was the Psychosis Classification Challenge. We were given the data of some patients, some of whom are suffering from Schizophrenia and some are suffering from Bipolar Disorder. The data were preprocessed from Resting State Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (rsf-MRI) data and the corresponding Brain Signals and their Correlation Coefficients were provided to us. Our task was to use this data and the knowledge of signal processing to develop a Machine Learning based Model which can classify these two types of patients on its own.

This year, the Problem Challenge and the Dataset was provided by Brain Space Initiative (BSI) and their competition website Link: https://brainspaceinitiative.github.io/competition/
